    "    *    RecNet ouputs scores that (a) indicate if neighboring regions should be merged (higher scores indicate merge), (b) a new representation for the merged region and (c) a class label for the new region\n",
    "    *    An outcome is therefore the representation of phrases/image regions in a dense vector space\n",
    "    *    Required training set: (a) parsed text, with labels for phrase type (e.g. noun phrase) (b) segmented images with region labels which are object categories (e.g. building)\n",
    "    *    The cost function is explicitly penalizes for syntactic and class label margin, i.e. semantic information is only implicitly captured"
